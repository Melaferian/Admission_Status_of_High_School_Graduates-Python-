The dataset of the project is about the admission status of high school graduates applying for universities. Mainly, this project is done by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA is one of a significant stage in analyzing data. In this stage, the data must be understood in order to obtain a great insight from it. The steps to do the EDA are:

* Preliminary look at the data
* Data cleaning (missing value and duplicate rows handling)
* Data deep-dive understanding (statistical summary, univariate analysis, and multivariate analysis.)
